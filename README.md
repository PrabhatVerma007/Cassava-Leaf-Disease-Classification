I understand you'd like a comprehensive README.md file. However, all the provided information (Repository, Description, Latest commit message, Recent changes) is marked as `undefined`.

Therefore, I cannot create a *specific* README for your project. Instead, I will provide a **professional and comprehensive README template** that you can easily adapt and fill in with your project's details. This template includes all the requested sections and best practices to make your project stand out to recruiters and potential collaborators.

Please replace all bracketed `[ ]` placeholders with your project's actual information.

## Description

[Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of your project. What does it do? What problem does it solve? Why is it useful? What technologies does it primarily use? This should be engaging for someone quickly scanning your repository.]

Example:
This project is a high-performance web-based data visualization tool designed to render complex datasets in real-time. It leverages React for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the backend API, and D3.js for interactive charting. Our goal is to provide researchers and analysts with an intuitive platform to explore their data with minimal setup.

## Features

*   [List key features or functionalities of your project. Use bullet points for readability.]
*   [Feature 1: Short description of what it does.]
*   [Feature 2: Short description of what it does.]
*   [Feature 3: Short description of what it does.]
*   [Add more features as needed.]

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

[List any software, libraries, or tools that need to be installed before running your project. Include version numbers if critical.]

Example:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or higher) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.x or higher)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   **For Node.js/JavaScript projects:**
        ```bash
        npm install
        # OR
        yarn install
        ```
    *   **For Python projects:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **For Go projects:**
        ```bash
        go mod download
        ```
    *   **For other languages/frameworks:**
        [Provide specific installation commands for your project's ecosystem.]

3.  **Set up environment variables (if applicable):**
    [Explain how to set up necessary environment variables, e.g., by creating a `.env` file from a template.]
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then edit .env with your specific values.
    ```

4.  **Build the project (if applicable):**
    *   **For front-end projects:**
        ```bash
        npm run build
        # OR
        yarn build
        ```
    *   **For compiled languages:**
        ```bash
        make build
        # OR
        go build
        ```
    *   [Provide any other build commands.]

## Usage

[Explain how to use your project once it's installed. Provide clear examples, including code snippets or command-line instructions. Show common use cases.]

Example for a web application:
1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[port-number]` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

Example for a command-line tool:
To perform a basic operation:
```bash
./[your-tool-name] --input data.csv --output result.json
```
To see all available commands and options:
```bash
./[your-tool-name] --help
```

Example for a library (show a basic code snippet):
```python
# main.py
from [your_package_name] import process_data

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = process_data(data)
print(f"Processed data: {result}")
```

## Configuration

[If your project requires specific configuration (e.g., API keys, database settings, custom parameters), explain how users can configure it. Refer to `.env` files, config files, or command-line arguments.]

Example:
Configuration settings can be found in `config/settings.js`. You can override these settings using environment variables, for example:
```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key npm start
```
For database connection details, refer to the `.env` file mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Running Tests

[Explain how to run the automated tests for your project.]

Example:
To run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
# OR
pytest
# OR
go test ./...
```
This will execute all unit and integration tests.
